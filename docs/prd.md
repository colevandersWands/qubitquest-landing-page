### **2.2 Detailed Feature Breakdown (User Stories)**

#### **2.2.1 The Quadratic Fluency Interface**

*   **As a user (Sam or Tina), I want to** view a single quantum concept presented simultaneously in four distinct panes (Plainspeak, Code, Circuit, Notation) **so that** I can build a holistic mental model and understand it from multiple perspectives at once.
*   **As a user, I want to** be able to select any pane as my primary "entry point" or focus for a task **so that** I can learn using the representation that is most intuitive for my background and the problem at hand.
*   **As a user, I want to** edit the content in one pane (e.g., drag-and-drop a gate in the Circuit pane) **so that** I can see the other three panes update in real-time to reflect the change, ensuring logical consistency across all representations.
*   **As a user, I want** the Plainspeak pane to automatically generate a clear, AI-powered explanation of the business implications of my code or circuit **so that** I can immediately connect technical actions to business value.

#### **2.2.2 The Spiral Curriculum**

*   **As a user, I want to** engage with a curriculum structured into modules based on real-world business scenarios (e.g., "Portfolio Optimization," "Drug Discovery Simulation") **so that** my learning is immediately applicable and contextually relevant.
*   **As a user, I want** each module to follow a five-phase progression (Hook, Contrast, Concepts, Practice, Reality Check) **so that** I am guided through a structured learning process that builds from motivation to deep, practical understanding.
*   **As a user, I want** the "Contrast" phase to provide a side-by-side comparison and visualization of a quantum solution versus a realistic, high-performance parallel classical solution **so that** I can understand the pragmatic trade-offs and avoid "quantum for quantum's sake."

#### **2.2.3 Simulation and Visualization**

*   **As a user, I want to** click a "Run" button to execute a simulation of the algorithm currently defined in the interface **so that** I can see the computational result.
*   **As a user, I want to** use a slider or input to change a problem's core parameter (e.g., database size) **so that** I can visualize how the estimated runtime for the quantum vs. classical solution scales, demonstrating concepts like quadratic speedup.
*   **As a user, I want to** step through the execution of a quantum circuit gate-by-gate **so that** I can see a visual representation of how the quantum state (e.g., qubit state vectors) evolves at each stage.

#### **2.2.4 Competency-Based Assessments**

*   **As a user, I want to** take a timed "Ambush" assessment that presents a business problem in the Plainspeak pane **so that** I can test my ability to solve problems and communicate solutions under realistic pressure.
*   **As a user, I want** my assessment score to be based on my "cognitive agility"—a metric that includes the quality of my final answer and the effectiveness of my process (e.g., how I utilized all four panes) **so that** I am evaluated on professional competency, not just theoretical knowledge.
*   **As a a user, I want to** practice translating a concept from one representation to another (e.g., being given a mathematical formula in the Notation pane and having to build the corresponding Circuit) **so that** I can solidify my fluency.

### **2.3 Data Requirements**

*   **User Data:** User Profile (Name, Email, Password Hash, Professional Role), Learning Progress (completed modules, phase progression), Competency Profile (assessment scores, performance analytics).
*   **Curriculum Data:** A structured system to store Modules, each containing five Phases. Each Phase must store content for the four representations:
    *   **Plainspeak:** Rich text content.
    *   **Code:** Python code snippets.
    *   **Circuit:** A serializable data structure (e.g., JSON) representing the quantum circuit, gates, and their connections.
    *   **Notation:** LaTeX strings for mathematical formulas.
*   **Analytics Data:** User interaction logs, including representation preferences (time spent in each pane), translation speed between panes, and common error patterns.
*   **Simulation Data:** Transient quantum state vectors generated during simulation for visualization purposes.
*   **Assessment Data:** Assessment scenarios, correct solution states, and scoring rubrics. User-submitted results must be stored and linked to the user's competency profile.

## **3.0 Non-Functional Requirements**

### **3.1 User Interface (UI) & User Experience (UX)**

*   **NFR-1:** The UI must be professional, modern, and minimalist, with a clean and technical aesthetic inspired by high-end IDEs (e.g., VS Code) and data visualization tools (e.g., Observable notebooks).
*   **NFR-2:** The primary interface will feature a dark theme to align with typical developer tooling and reduce eye strain during extended use.
*   **NFR-3:** The four-pane synchronization must feel instantaneous to the user. The maximum acceptable latency between a user action in one pane and the visible update in all other panes is **500ms**.
*   **NFR-4:** The platform must provide a seamless, intuitive experience. Despite the complexity of the subject matter, navigation and interaction with the core interface must be simple and discoverable.
*   **NFR-5:** The platform must render mathematical notation from LaTeX clearly and accurately.

### **3.2 Platform & Environment**

*   **NFR-6:** The primary platform will be a web application accessible via all modern, mainstream web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
*   **NFR-7:** The application must be responsive, with a primary focus on desktop and laptop screen sizes. A functional, readable experience on tablets is a secondary requirement.
*   **NFR-8:** The platform requires a persistent internet connection to function; there is no requirement for offline mode.

### **3.3 Constraints & Business Rules**

*   **NFR-9:** The synchronization of the four panes is the central, non-negotiable feature and must be maintained at all times. An update in one representation *must* result in a consistent state across all four.
*   **NFR-10:** All curriculum content must be grounded and verifiable. Concepts must not be presented as "magic"; they must be demonstrably consistent across all four representations.
*   **NFR-11:** The pedagogical structure (spiral curriculum with 5-phase modules) is a mandatory constraint for all learning content.
*   **NFR-12:** Assessments must focus on professional competency (communication, problem-solving, feasibility analysis) rather than purely academic physics or mathematics.
*   **NFR-13:** The platform must explicitly avoid forcing users into a single, rigid learning path. While modules are structured, the system must allow users to engage with content starting from any representation (a "contextual entry point").

### **3.4 Security & Privacy Considerations**

*   **NFR-14:** All user authentication must be secure, with passwords hashed and salted.
*   **NFR-15:** All personally identifiable information (PII) must be handled with care and stored securely, in compliance with standard data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR).
*   **NFR-16:** The platform will use HTTPS to encrypt all data in transit.

## **4.0 Success Criteria & Acceptance Criteria**

*   **Success Metric 1: High Course Completion Rate:** Course completion rates should significantly exceed the MOOC average, targeting >25%.
*   **Success Metric 2: Positive User Feedback:** Achieve a Net Promoter Score (NPS) of >60 from users who complete at least one module.
*   **Success Metric 3: Measurable Competency Lift:** >80% of users who complete an assessment should show measurable improvement in "cognitive agility" metrics between their first and last attempts.

### **Acceptance Criteria (Example Scenarios)**

*   **AC-1: Proving Quadratic Speedup:**
    *   **Given:** A user is in the "Contrast" phase of the "Database Search" module.
    *   **When:** The user sees a side-by-side visualization of classical parallel search and quantum search with a slider for "database size."
    *   **And:** The user moves the slider from 10,000 to 10,000,000 entries.
    *   **Then:** The visualization's estimated time-to-completion for the classical search must grow at a visibly greater rate than the quantum search's, correctly illustrating the concept.

*   **AC-2: Translation from Notation to Circuit:**
    *   **Given:** A user is in the "Practice" phase and is shown a research paper snippet in the Notation pane.
    *   **When:** The user correctly drags and drops gates onto the Circuit pane canvas to implement the formula.
    *   **Then:** The Code pane must auto-generate the equivalent Python/Qiskit code, and the Plainspeak pane must generate a bulleted list explaining what the implemented algorithm accomplishes in business terms.

*   **AC-3: The "Ambush" Assessment Flow:**
    *   **Given:** A user starts a timed "Ambush" assessment and is presented a business problem in the Plainspeak pane.
    *   **When:** The user switches to the Circuit pane, sketches a potential solution, then refines the auto-generated code in the Code pane, and writes their final recommendation in the Plainspeak pane.
    *   **Then:** Upon submission, the platform must provide a multi-faceted score that evaluates the correctness of the solution, the time taken, and the efficiency of pane usage (number of switches, edits per pane).

## **5.0 Future Considerations / Roadmap**

*   **Version 1.5:**
    *   **Collaborative Mode:** Introduce functionality for teams to work together within a single Quadratic Fluency Interface to solve problems.
    *   **AI Tutor:** Enhance the AI assistant to provide Socratic feedback on user problem-solving strategies and translations.
*   **Version 2.0:**
    *   **Hardware Integration:** Implement direct integration with real quantum hardware backends (e.g., IBM Quantum Network, AWS Braket, Google Quantum AI), allowing users to run code on actual quantum computers.
    *   **Enterprise Features:** Build out a suite of B2B features, including team management dashboards, bulk license purchasing, and custom curriculum development.
*   **Long-Term Vision:**
    *   **Pedagogy Templating:** Abstract the "Quadratic Fluency" model into a framework that can be applied to teach other complex domains (e.g., AI/ML, FinTech, Genomics), positioning the platform as a leader in advanced technical education.
